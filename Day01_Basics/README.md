# Day 01 – JavaScript Basics

## Objective
To keep JavaScript logic sharp alongside Java DSA practice.
This includes basic syntax, variables, loops, and simple operations.

## Topics Covered
- Variables
- Basic arithmetic
- for loop
- console output

## Programs
1. square.js  
   - Takes a number and prints its square.

2. loop.js  
   - Prints a string multiple times using a loop.

## Notes
- This repository focuses on logic practice, not heavy DSA in JavaScript.
- Same concepts are practiced in Java for DSA.
